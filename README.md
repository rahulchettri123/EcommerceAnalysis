# EcommerceAnalysis

The project is focused on analyzing data for an E-commerce company. The first step is data wrangling and cleaning up the data. This involves converting columns to their proper datatype and structuring the data. Once the data is clean, the analysis begins.

The project aims to answer several questions, such as what was the best month for sales and what time should the company display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases. The project also seeks to determine what products are most often sold together, which product sold the most, and which countries have the most customers.

In addition to these questions, the project delves into customer segmentation. The company has identified seven different segments of customers based on their purchasing behavior. The project examines the percentage of customers in each segment and offers insights into how the company can target and retain customers in each segment. For example, 24.1% of the company's customers fall into the hibernation segment, indicating that they have not made a purchase in a long time. The project suggests strategies to attract these customers back to the company.

Overall, this project is focused on providing insights to the E-commerce company to help them improve their sales and customer retention strategies.
